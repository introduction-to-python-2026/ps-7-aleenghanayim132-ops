Data Exploration and Correlation Analysis

The California Housing dataset was used to explore relationships
between different housing-related features.

Several numerical features were examined, including median income, house age,
average number of rooms, population, and median house value.

The correlation scatter plot focused on the relationship between median income
(MedInc) and median house value (MedHouseVal).

The plot shows a strong positive correlation between median income and house value.
As the median income of an area increases, the median house value also tends to
increase.

This relationship is expected, as areas with higher income levels generally have
more expensive housing. The regression line in the scatter plot further highlights
this positive linear trend.
